      <h1 class="heading">Green Closet: A Sustainable Clothing Brand</h1>
      <p>
        During my freshman year at Babson, through the FME entrepreneurship
        group, with a group of students I created Green Closet a clothing brand
        focused on school spirit and sustainability in an industry known for
        waste. We produced and sold Babson t-shirts with elegant designs meant
        to enhance school spirit. The shirts were made of organic cotton which
        uses 92% less water in production than alternative forms of cotton. The
        shirts were produced in Turkey in accordance to all fair labor
        standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was apart of the green closet team from its inception and led the
        process of pivoting from our initial idea of using plastic waste
        collected from the ocean in the production of our shirts. Once our
        products were in production I shifted my focus to marketing the product,
        mainly using digital media and eye-catching skits to capture attention
        in a crowded advertising environment. Our venture ended up turning a
        profit greater than $1000 which was donated to a charity supporting
        production of organic cotton.

        Thanksgiving Food Drive with the Boston Housing Authority
      </h2>
      <p>
        This fall I was named the head of the community service board of SAAC
        (student-athlete advisory council). My first major initiative as head of
        community service was organizing a Thanksgiving food drive with a local
        organization. I had a connection with the Boston Housing Authority from
        high school and knew that they provided many people in Boston with food
        around Thanksgiving. I reached out to them and the rest of SAAC and was
        pleased that there was mutual interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The food drive ended up being a massive success with the entirety of
        Babson Athletics participating. We were able to provide ~50 families
        with food for Thanksgiving. Getting Babson Athletics involved with the
        Boston Housing Authority for the Thanksgiving food drive was special to
        me as I was able to connect a community with so much to give with a
        group that could use support. I was really moved by the amount of
        participation from my fellow athletes. I hope that Babson Athletics
        supports the Boston Housing Authority for years to come.

        Understanding Celebrity Partnerships: Vitamin Water and 50 Cent
      </h3>
      <p>
        As a part of Len Green's Ultimate Entrepreneurial Challenge course this
        past fall, groups were given case studies that they would then have to
        present their findings to business executive from the company discussed
        in the case. One of my better presentations came when we were given a
        case on Vitamin Water and how it was able to compete in a saturated
        drink market. I focused my analysis on how Vitamin Water changed the way
        celebrity partnerships were constructed forever when they partnered with
        rapper, 50 Cent. Where most companies gave celebrities a large sum of
        money, Vitamin Water had limited capital and opted to give 50 Cent
        equity in the company.50 Cent was already a huge fan of the beverage and
        could connect with the company as they both were underdog success
        stories with ties to New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought a creative and engaging way to build my presentation would be
        to use 50 Cent lyrics that described why their partnership was
        successful for both parties and so unique for the time period. The
        pre-recorded video presentation captured the gritty, hustler mentality
        that allowed Vitamin Water founder, Mike Repole, to be such a success.
        Mike Repole really enjoyed my presentation and highlighted how taking
        unique approaches that authentically connect people, giving people a
        vested interest in a company's lasting success and striving for product
        excellence were the keys to his success with Vitamin Water, NoBull, and
        BodyArmor.
