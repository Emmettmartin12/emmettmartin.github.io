      I chose Babson mainly because of its diverse community, the rigorous
      academics, diversified business curriculum and the opportunity to compete
      on a competitive division 3 lacrosse team. I thought that going to a
      college that is not only national, but also international would expose me
      to different ways of thinking and better me. Babson was a highly ranked
      school, but more than the prestige the diversity of coursework was
      attractive to me as I was a high schooler interested in business but
      unsure what exactly I wanted to pursue. Lastly, the opportunity to compete
      on a nationally ranked lacrosse team was attractive to me as I loved to
      play and am a competitive person. Those are the key factors that drove me
      to attending Babson.

      My favorite sport is, and has been for many years, the game of
      <em>lacrosse</em>. I have played since I was in kindergarten, so about 17
      years. The sport was not my first love as I grew up loving the game of
      hockey and was obsessed with the Boston Bruins, but by the time I reached
      middle school I knew I wanted to take it more seriously. I played on
      nationally competitive travel and high school teams which was a blast in
      high school. I love to play the game in large part due to the fact that it
      is great exercise, it requires cardio, hand eye coordination, full body
      strength and mobility, and IQ. As I have gotten older I have come to
      appreciate the community and friendships I have built through the game. I
      am close to hundreds of people that I have played, with or against which I
      find quite special.
